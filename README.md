# GNNtutorial
A short (15 min) tutorial on Graph Neural Networks

A Jupyter Notebook to understand the basics of Graph Neural Networks.
It covers:
* creating a graph with networkx and a matrix of node features,
* how the GNN layer create embeddings and aggregate information at each node,
* Key properties and limitations of GNNs.
